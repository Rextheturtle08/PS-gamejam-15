# Shadows and Alchemy Idea 1

I realize this game is beyond something we can fully develop with our current skills, but we could likely create a good frame work with a limited number of puzzles and some sort of simple brewing mini game.

Not sure this would be preferred or a more simple game we could more fully implement. 

## Genre

Stealth puzzle game

## Game Flow Summary

The game would be broken into individual level each would involve two parts. Find a alchemy recipe and brewing the result. 

To get the recipe would involve puzzles and involve some suspicious activities such as breaking into room by picking locks and opening safes, solving ciphers with info in a room and watching other alchemists in the room. 

## Project Scope 

The main goal of completion for this game jam would be a basic brewing system and some levels with relatively simple mechanics to show the possibilities of the game. 

## Section II - Gameplay and  Mechanics

### Shadows

Shadows in the case of this game refer to stealth mechanics or "working from the shadows". This would be implemented with limited vision for the player and visible view cones for NPC's. 

### Alchemy

The premise of this game is to work your way through a alchemy lab to the lowest level where the gold is made and steal the recipe.

### Puzzle Structure

Puzzles would have many forms such as solving ciphers in a room where if you stay in the same area too long while in vision of alchemist they get suspicious. Locks might need to be picked or hidden compartments found. Some information may also be able to be collected by watching alchemists in the laboratories. Ciphers and puzzles provide recipes for potion when user must then brew.

### Objectives

You must complete some sort of alchemy product and carry it through the exit to move to the next level. If an alarm is raised you fail immediately.

Might be required to kill for some objectives not sure I like this idea.

### Movement

Simple movement using arrow keys.

### Objects

Simple inventory system where items are displayed in the corner of the screen and clicking on them expands them expanding them in the middle of the screen and clicking again minimizes them. No need to drop items.

### Reading

Notes you find would be in the players inventory for the player to read.

### Combat

While there is no combat the NPC's will follow predictable patterns. At least in the lower levels.

### Screen Flow

We would need a screen or scene for the main screen as well as each level and minigame/puzzle in the game. 

### Screen Descriptions

Main menu screen to select level already completed and the next possible level.

Options screen for audio levels, light levels ect.

level screen for each level.

We would need a screen for most puzzles and would be a large source of work for us.

### Game Options

No additional options at this time.

### Replaying and Saving 

Likely just save complete number of levels as a cookie of possible? Needs research depending on engine.
